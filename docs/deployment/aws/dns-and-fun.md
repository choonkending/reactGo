:information_source: A **DNS service** routes internet traffic to your website by translating friendly domain names such as www.example.com into numeric IP addresses such as 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other

For my personal site, I decided to migrate my DNS service to using Amazon Route 53.
